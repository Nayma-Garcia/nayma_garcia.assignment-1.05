    12:10PM: Started working on the next assignment. Started by modifying the main function to handle the input. I started with just handling the input that moves the pc, i plan on adding the other commands in later.
    1:30PM: Had some issues with the pc moving very slow, but the TA said that was fine during office hours, might fix later.

	4:00pm: I started working on getting the list of trainers to show up. I was very confused on how to do this so i went to office hours. 
    8:00pm I figured out how to display the list of trainers. I then made functions to find where each trainer was in relation to the PC, i then called those functions in my main function. At first i displayed it under my map but then i figured out how to display it ON the map by clearing a space around it.

    3:30pm: Today I just worked with the ncurses colors a bit, i only added color to the PC to make it easier to see though. I also updated my readme and am ready to turn in. Might add more color later if I have time.
