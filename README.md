## Project for COMS 327 at Iowa State University. This is the 5th homework that works on our project.

This project allows the user to control the player character (PC) around the map. It also adds new screens where the player can see how far each trainer is by pressing 't'. 
The player also engages in battles with the trainers (its just a placeholder text for now though). The player can also enter PokeCenters & PokeMarts (also just placeholder text for now)
